# editor
I swore I made this private but I guess I didn't :laughing: There is nothing here to see yet really, just notes on what this could be.

Not just a linter, an editor to help you write human-readable code.

Some folks are going to hate the idea. That's ok! I don't think this is ever going to be a tool for everyone, and I don't think I'd ever encourage, say, having it as a blocking step in a build pipeline.

It's also not intended to supplant language-specific linters -- if this tool contradicts any of those more specific tools, please accept their recommendations instead!

It's purely to help make suggestions about code readability! And all such automated suggestions should only be applied with your best judgement--at the end of the day, you're the human, and you'll always be the best entity to make stylistic judgement calls about your codebase.
