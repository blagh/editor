# editor
Not just a linter, an editor to help you write human-readable code.

Some folks are going to hate it. That's ok! I don't think this is ever going to be a tool for everyone, and I don't think I'd ever encourage, say, having it as a blocking step in a build pipeline.

It's also not intended to supplant language-specific linters, so if this tool contradicts any of those more specific tools, please accept their recommendations instead!

It's purely to help make suggestions about code readability! And all such automated suggestions should be applied with your best judgement--at the end of the day, you're the human who will be the best at making such judgement calls.
