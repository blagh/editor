# editor
Not just a linter, an editor to help you write human-readable code.

Some folks are going to hate it. That's ok! I don't think this is ever going to be a tool for everyone, and I don't think I'd ever encourage, say, having it as a blocking step in a build pipeline.

It's also not intended to supplant language-specific linters, so if this tool contradicts any of those more specific tools, please accept their recommendations instead!

It's purely a tool to help make suggestions about code readability, and all such automated suggestions should be applied with your best judgement (you're the human, after all).
