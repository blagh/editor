# editor
Not just a linter, an editor to help you write human-readable code.

Some folks are going to hate it. That's ok! I don't think this is ever going to be a tool for everyone, and I don't think I'd ever encourage having it as a blocking step in a build pipeline.

It's purely a tool to help make suggestions about how your code could be made to be more readable by other humans.
